# Z80onMDRpi

Based on Z80onMDR_Lite but with a simple LZ compressor which gives slightly worse compression but is much faster, useful for lower end
processors like that on the Pi Zero


Some examples:

Renegade - Lite version 5.8s and using 72sectors on the cartridge, Pi version 0.57s and 80 sectors used

International Rugby Simulator - Lite version 16.3s and using 53sectors on the cartridge, Pi version 0.48s and 59 sectors used
